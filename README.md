# Distributed-programming-technologies

A set of technologies used in client-server applications. 
The idea was to look into each technology in a very detailed way, to understand how data flows, 
what problems we may encounter. For example, when the client is restared, the old operations are still ruiing, because 
it was detached from the emory, but wasn't terminated.

Used <b>Tomcat, Spring, Java Servlet, JSP, XML, Maven, Gradle, Hibernate</b>
